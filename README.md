This was my first time using Android Studio, so the app has some bugs (a lot lol).
It was a school proyect where we had 1 week to learn how to use Android Studio and to develop an Android App with funcional Log-In/Register and some other features.

I upload it here so yall know we've all had a first time at something (and probably my last time with android studio because that app was breaking my old pc ðŸ˜­)

I named it after my surname because i didn`t know what name would be great to an unfinished app. :D
